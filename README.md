# Sorted Group tech tests

## Test details

This project is a small microblog. It has some test data served from a static file, and allows new posts to be added.

Please complete the following tasks:

- Update the header CSS so that the logo and heading sit next to each other, and are centered horizontally and vertically (note: this project uses pure CSS)
- In the Lister component:
    - Implement render code so that the tests pass
    - Implement onCreatePost and onDeletePost. Do not attempt to persist the changes - just update state. The `<CreatePost />` component has already been created for you
- Implement the reducer in the CreatePost component so that the tests pass
